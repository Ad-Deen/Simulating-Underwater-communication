    Calculate the acoustic attenuation in seawater using the Thorp attenuation model.

    Parameters:
    - frequency (float): Frequency of the acoustic signal in kHz.
    - distance (float): Distance traveled by the signal in meters.
    - temperature (float, optional): Water temperature in degrees Celsius. Default is 20.0Â°C.
