def thorpe_attenuation(frequency, distance, temperature=30.0, salinity=1.0):
    """
    Calculate the acoustic attenuation in seawater using the Thorp attenuation model.

    Parameters:
    - frequency (float): Frequency of the acoustic signal in kHz.
    - distance (float): Distance traveled by the signal in meters.
    - temperature (float, optional): Water temperature in degrees Celsius. Default is 20.0Â°C.
    - salinity (float, optional): Water salinity in parts per thousand (ppt). Default is 35.0 ppt.

    Returns:
